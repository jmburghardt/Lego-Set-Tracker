# lego-set-tracker
Project
This is meant to be an easy way for children and parents (and adult collectors!) to track what sets they own and set up wishlists for their
friends and family. Each user can log in to see their own list of sets and friends, browse all lego sets, see their friends' wishlists, and
have the option to show other users they bought the set for someone without that person knowing, to keep the surprise. This is using the 
Rebrickable API for the lego set database and myphp to keep track of user set list, friends list, and wishlist.
